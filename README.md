# Project-Programming-1
This is the public project for Programming 1 by Carlos and Thomas.
In this project, we have the Spotify Data set and accompanying graphs to answer the following questions.
Which genres were top most streamed?
Does the length of a track name affect its popularity?
How long are the popular songs? Are they short, long, or a sweet spot in the middle?
How many tracks do the top artists have in the top 100 for 2025?
Are specific artists having a monopoly on their genres?
How many artists in the Top 100 are considered “Break Out” artists?
What are the defining characteristics of a song that make it a success on Spotify?
What we found from the Spotify Data set is that in order to have the highest probability of success on Spotify in 2025, your song should have the following characteristics: 
Be in any of these genres: Pop, country, or hip hop, be 2:45-4:00 minutes long, peaking between 3:15-3:45, have a short title (1-2 words long),
and you must already have a strong following, otherwise your chances of success are minimal.
